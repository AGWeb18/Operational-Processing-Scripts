### Split Large CSV into Multiple Workbooks - Python
Use this utility to 'break-apart' large CSV's into smaller, more managable files. 

### Getting Started 
1. Change the **SRC_PATH** and **SRC_FILE** to reflect where the Large file is stored. 
2. Update the DST_PATH and DST_FILE to reflect the name/location of the smaller chunks.
