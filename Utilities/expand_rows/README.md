### Getting Started

- Ensure the correct column is being referenced: 
```vb
quantity_field = "U"
```

### Validation
- Prior to running the script, take note of the SUM of the quantity field you're expanding on. 
- The results file should contain the same number of rows, as the original file had SUM in the quantity field.
